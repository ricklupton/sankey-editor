# Sankey editor

**See the latest running version:** https://sankey-editor.netlify.com/

This is a prototype Sankey diagram editor, based on
[d3-sankey-diagram](https://github.com/ricklupton/d3-sankey-diagram). You can
drag the nodes around to tweak the diagram.

## Usage

Export a JSON file from the latest version of
[floWeaver](https://github.com/ricklupton/floWeaver). Drag it into the editor
page -- your Sankey diagram should appear.

**Warning:** The JSON format is still under development. Make sure you are using
the latest version of floWeaver to stay compatible with this editor.

To move nodes, drag them using the mouse:
- by default nodes move vertically
- hold down `Ctrl` to move horizontally
